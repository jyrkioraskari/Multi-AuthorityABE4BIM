This software implements the Decentralized CiphertextPolicy Attribute Based Encryption schema described in [1].
The code depends on the jPBC library [2] and the BouncyCastle library.

The software is a result of the PriSM project [3] developed by the SANDS [4] team at the Nanyang Technological University [5].
